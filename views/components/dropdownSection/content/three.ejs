    111Project believes in a community of care model. Children are cared by families, families are cared by churches, and the community supports and surrounds these efforts. When any part of this structure is broken down a community of support is lost. Ultimately the family is the front-line response to the child welfare crisis and the institution that God created to take care of children. Everyone believes children are better in safe and loving families. 111Project would be honored to assist you, no matter your families makeup, in discerning Godâ€™s next steps in your engagement. We need families willing to advocate, be point people in their churches, coordinate engagement in their community, serve families in crisis, foster and offer biblical hospitality, and even pursue adoption and become a forever family. We would be honored to serve you and your family in this way.
