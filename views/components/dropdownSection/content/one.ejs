    The vision of 111Project has always been to <strong>mobilize the local church so every child has a family.</strong> It is for this purpose that 111Project exists. We believe that the local church desires to not only proclaim the gospel to the whole world but to display it in a way that brings God’s kingdom on earth as it is in heaven. To identify injustices and alleviate suffering by helping the stranger become neighbor and neighbors to become family is made plain in passages like James 1:27, Psalms 68:5-6, &amp; Matthew 25:35-40 and countless others.

    The reality is that in every community across Oklahoma, there are children and families in crisis, but there are also local churches willing to help. Often these opportunities require the church and state agencies to work together. 111Project bridges the gap between resources and opportunities by equipping local churches to engage directly with the issue of foster care. Through a unified church <strong>initiating prayer, resources, volunteers, and ultimately families in an intentional discipleship process</strong> we believe there can be families waiting on children instead of children waiting on families.
    
    There are more than 6200 churches in Oklahoma. Our goal is to see over 1000 Oklahoma churches provide more than enough families to alleviate the foster care crisis in our state. <strong>We can see this simple reality by every church recruiting and supporting one new foster family every year and making a connection with one child welfare family every month.</strong> County by County, we’re calling the local church to lead in bringing a resolution to this crisis by 2022.
    
    <strong><em>Will you pledge your church to be a part of the movement to end the child welfare crisis in Oklahoma?</em></strong>
