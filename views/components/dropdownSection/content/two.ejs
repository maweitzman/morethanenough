                        <span>We ask every church to commit at least one Sunday a year to advocating to see that every child has a family as part of a Sunday morning service.  There are lots of ways to make it fit in an annual church calendar and adjust the day to meet the needs of your congregation.  We know that if every church makes this commitment we can solve this crisis together.  Ultimately, we believe this is a biblical directive of discipleship.</span>

                        <span>Biblical hospitality to strangers is a call for all believers, but we also recognize it does not happen without intentionality. We ask each church to commit to recruit a point person—staff or volunteer—who will interface regularly with the 111Project to help families engage and facilitate regularly support of foster care initiatives within your church, such as recruitment meetings and meeting Care Portal requests.</span>
